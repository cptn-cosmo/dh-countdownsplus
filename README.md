# Daggerheart Countdowns Plus

A simple module for the **Daggerheart** system on Foundry VTT that improves the usability of the countdown tracker.

## Features

- **Detachable Tracker**: Adds a "Detach" button to the default systems countdown/fear tracker.
- **Movable Window**: The detached tracker opens in its own window that can be dragged anywhere on the screen, minimizing obstruction of the game canvas.
- **System Tracker Integration**: While the detached tracker is open, the default system tracker (pinned to the top right) is hidden to avoid clutter. Closing the detached tracker automatically restores the system tracker.

## Installation

1.  Open the Foundry VTT Setup screen.
2.  Go to **Add-on Modules**.
3.  Click **Install Module**.
4.  Search for "Daggerheart Countdowns Plus" or paste the manifest URL.
5.  Click **Install**.

## Usage

1.  Open a world with the **Daggerheart** system.
2.  Enable the **Daggerheart Countdowns Plus** module in **Game Settings** > **Manage Modules**.
3.  Look for the "Detach" icon (an arrow pointing out of a square) in the header of the standard Countdown/Fear tracker.
4.  Click it to pop out the tracker into a movable window.
